# The Marvel Directory

## Description

Our project allows the user/us to look up certain characters or groups in the MCU.
Other than this being a project due and graded we had wanted to test our limitation and see the possibilities of education.
Overall, This has been fun and awarding. We now have more ideas and options we would like to implement and possibly use this as a stepping stone.

# Feature
You can look up certain characters/groups in the Marvel universe with a lot of limitation. 
Due to the fact this API is either not optimized or we are not fully understanding the API we are not able to look up the entire Marvel Comic Universe.
Here are the selected characters and groups that do work.
- Avengers
- Guardians of the Galaxy
- X-Men
- Wolverine
- Thor
- Captain America
